            The game files in this folder are included to make it easier
            for young children to play Dinosaur Safari.

            The files allow you to select the level of difficulty of the
            game.  Rookie is the normal (hardest) level.  Junior,
            Senior, and Ace levels are each progressively easier
            (because you have additional tools at your disposal).

            The plus (ending with _X) files allow you to start with
            extra Energy Credits.  Standard games start with 200 Energy
            Credits.  Plus games start with 1000 Energy Credits.

            To use any of these files just run the program, go to the
            office and select "Open Game".  The files are called:

                 ROOKIE.DSS
                 ROOKIE_X.DSS
                 JUNIOR.DSS
                 JUNIOR_X.DSS
                 SENIOR.DSS
                 SENIOR_X.DSS
                 ACE.DSS
                 ACE_X.DSS

            For very young children (ie, 4-6 years old) an adult or
            older child should play the game through to Star Level and
            then save the game.  Double-clicking on this saved game will
            permit very young children to look at all the Dinosaur
            animations in the Cladogram Room, flip through the NCS
            Special Issue Datazine in the Office and explore the
            Mesozoic world with unlimited Energy Credits and Data
            Crystals.

            And don't forget to look at the Hint Book in the Office !
